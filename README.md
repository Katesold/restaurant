# Restaurant Reviews Application
---

## Project Overview: ## 
**Restaurant Reviews App** project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Responsive design with accessibility features was created, while the web app has an offline first approach. That is, service worker is used to make the site workable offline as well.

## Instructions
1. Create a localhost using command prompt or git bash on the server 8000:
Use the command py -m http.server 8000

2. Open a browser and type in: localhost:8000

The web app should be available now.

Thank you
